## **DATASET**

> Ford GoBike system data; this data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset contain 183412 rows and 16 columns.
>
> I will be using this dataset to predict if the individual used to bike to complete the trip or not.

## **SUMMARY OF FINDINGS**

> From investigation and exploration on the data set, I found out that the rate of completion of the trip using the bike-sharing system depends on certain features, this features includes - member_birth_year, member_gender, duration_sec, user_type etc.

> From the viz in my project, I can clearly state that duration of the trip affects as trips having longer duration are mostly not completed. Also, the member_birth_year affect the trips, the older members using the service tend not to complete their trips. I also found out that no customer using the service completed the trip.

## **KEY INSIGHTS FOR PRESENTATION**

> For my presentation, I will be focusing on the factors that affected the completion of the trips by individuals who used the bikes. Such factors included the duration of the trip in seconds, the age on the biker and the user type.
